1.Complete automatic calibration
    -complete arduino program
    -connect arduino with app
    -sort out input messaging, queue for keyboard input is not optimal, make like OPENCV waitKey(timeout)
    -test if iothread and controllerthread interrupt when prompted (dequeue)
    -fix bug when pressing space while no process like calibration is active the calibration command does not work
